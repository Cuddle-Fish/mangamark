## Goals:
- no longer have to remove old bookmarks
- easier tracking and visualization of reading history
- provide better/ automatic filtering

## Tasks:
### Step 1:
- display site url, title of content and current chapter
  - separate title and chapter, discard group name if present
- store info locally
  - sort by domain name then title
### Step 2:
- check if title already exist
  - if title exist update chapter and url
### Step 3:
- 



## For Consideration:
### How should new titles be handled?
#### what happens when adding a new title from a chapter:
- display message (New title (add/cancel): ?)
- just add title
- make card image just first letter of title
#### button to add new title w/ image:
- find cover via keyword search or manually select image
